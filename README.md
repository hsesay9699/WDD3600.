# WDD3600 Shopping App (Weekly Build)

This repository contains my ongoing WDD3600 shopping application that is built week-by-week by following the course video tutorial series.

## Week 3 (Chapters 6–7)
- Added MVC structure (models, controllers, routes)
- Added EJS views (no Pug/Handlebars required for this assignment)
- Added product model that stores products in a JSON file (`data/products.json`)
- Added controllers with required code comments (`controllers/products.js`, `controllers/error.js`)
- Added CSS files (from instructor provided zip) in `public/css`

## How to run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open in your browser:
   - Shop page: http://localhost:3000/
   - Add Product: http://localhost:3000/admin/add-product
